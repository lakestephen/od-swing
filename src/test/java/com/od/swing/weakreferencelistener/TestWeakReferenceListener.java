/**
* keep a firm ref to JButtons we create, so that we can test that weak reference listeners added to the
* buttons can be removed from the buttons by the cleanup thread and gc'd, once their delegateListeners have been gc'd
*
* When each MyCollectable is created, it wraps it's actionListener with a weak reference listener
* and registers the weak reference listner with the button to listen for button action events
*
* Since a weak reference listener was added to the button, the MyCollectables are are available for gc.
* Once a MyCollectable is gc'd, the weak ref listener cleanup thread should then remove
* weak reference proxy listeners from these buttons, and the weak ref listener should
* then itself be freed up for gc
*
* We can check this works by keeping a local collection of weak references to the weak reference listeners
* created by MyCollectable. At the end of the test, some of these weak references should have had their referant
* weak reference listener garbage collected - proving that weak reference listeners are successfully being removed
* from the JButtons by the cleanup thread and are freed for gc as expected
